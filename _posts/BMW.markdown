description: A project at the end of my second year in SUTD: We were tasked to identify and ideate on problems that the elderly and assistive care sectors will face. After an outing trip with a group of wheelchair-bound clients, our team realized the positive impact that a motorized wheelchair will bring about to the user, and how uncommon it is in the community. Our prototype can be assembled in less than 5 minutes, and at half the cost of an off-the-shelf motorized wheelchair.
