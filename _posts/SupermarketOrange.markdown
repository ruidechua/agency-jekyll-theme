description: A project at the end of the first year in SUTD, we were tasked to solve a problem through various problem scoping, ideation, refining, and rapid prototyping techniques taught in the module. Our team has chosen the problem of supermarket queues, and after various rounds of ideation, surveying and simulations, we have come up with a solution that could reduce waiting times by almost 3 minutes.
